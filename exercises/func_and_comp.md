### Problem 1 Word Mapping

Write a program that maps a list of words into a list of integers representing the lengths of the correponding words. Write it in three different ways: 1) using a for-loop, 2) using the higher order function map(), and 3) using list comprehensions.

### Problem 2 Longest Word
Write a function find_longest_word() that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one. Write it in two ways. 1) Use only higher order functions. 2) Use lambda.
