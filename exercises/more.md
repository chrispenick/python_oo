### Simple
1. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.
2. Define a function `is_palindrome()` that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards). For example, `is_palindrome("radar")` should return `True`.
3. Write a version of a palindrome recognizer that also accepts phrase palindromes such as "Go hang a salami I'm a lasagna hog.", "Was it a rat I saw?", "Step on no pets", "Sit on a potato pan, Otis", "Lisa Bonet ate no basil", "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas", "I roamed under it as a tired nude Maori", "Rise to vote sir", or the exclamation "Dammit, I'm mad!". Note that punctuation, capitalization, and spacing are usually ignored.

### Medium
1. Write a function `char_freq()` that takes a string and builds a frequency listing of the characters contained in it. Represent the frequency listing as a Python dictionary. Try it with something like `char_freq("abbabcbdbabdbdbabababcbcbab")`.
2. Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user should pick a random choice: r, p, or s and then see the one the program picked. (We'll assume the computer isn't cheating by picking after the user.) Keep track of the score. Print the results as you go through the game. Give the user an option to quit.
### Difficult
1. An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; e.g., orchestra = carthorse. Using the word list at http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, write a program that finds the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most words in them.
