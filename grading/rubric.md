| Correct  |   35%   | Program runs with no errors. All requirements are met. At least one optional feature is implemented.  | Program runs with no errors. All requirements are met.  | Program can be made to crash with unusual input, or some minor requirements are missing.  | Program can be made to crash, or some requirements are missing.  | Program crashes during normal operation, or many requirements are missing.  |
| Readable  |   10%   | Code is consistently formatted. Variable and function names clearly indicate what they do or are used for. Docstrings are used appropriately.  | One or two formatting inconsistencies, or one or two poorly-named variables or functions.  | Formatting inconsistencies in large or multiple areas, or a number of poorly-named variables or functions.  | Extremely inconsistent formatting, or many poorly-named variables.  | No pattern or logic to formatting.  |
| Usable|   5%   | The program is extremely usable; interfaces are well documented, even for a novice user.  | The code is usable and has decent user documentation.  | The code is usable with one or a couple of non-intuitive and/or undocumented features.  | The code is usable with many non-intuitive and/or undocumented features.  | The code is unusable and/or lacks instructions.  |
| Architecture  |   30%   | Uses excellent choices for data types and class structure. Program flow is easy to follow.  | Uses good choices for data types and classes. Program may have small inconsistencies.  | At least one data type or class structure was a poor choice. Program flow may be confusing at times.  | A few poor choices in data types or class design. Program flow is confusing throughout.  | Poor choices in data types. Classes are poorly structured. Program flow is jumbled, incorrect, or missing.  |
| Idiomatic  |   10%   | Code shows familiarity with PEP 8 and Python conventions where appropriate.  | Code generally follows PEP 8 and Python conventions but may have an inconsistency or two.  | Code has multiple inconsistencies with PEP 8 and Python conventions.  | Code has numerous PEP 8 misunderstandings.  | Code has no discernible style or convention. Style choices are complete haphazard.  |
| Efficient  |   5%   | The code is efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding.  | The code is fairly efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding.	  | The code is brute force and unnecessarily long.	  | The code is huge and appears to be patched together.  | No effort for efficiency made.  |
| Version Control  |   5%   | Commit messages are descriptive and clear. Each commit is independent of the other. Code builds successfully at each commit in the master or mainline branch.  | Each commit generally fixes or addresses an independent issue. One or two commits in the mainline branch may not build successfully.  | Some commits address disparate issues. Some commits in the mainline branch may not build successfully. Some commit messages are terse or unclear.  | Multiple issues addressed in a single commit. Multiple mainline commits do not build. Many commit messages are terse or unclear.  | Code is in just one large commit, or no version control is used.  |
