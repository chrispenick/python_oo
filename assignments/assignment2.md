## Interactive Fiction

Write an interactive fiction game. It may be as deep or shallow as you like, though obviously greater care in execution will result in a better grade. It should be possible to beat the game given the following instructions:

	GET ALL
	OPEN DOOR
	EAST
	GET EDELWEISS
	UP
	ENTER CAVE
	LIGHT FIRE
	WAIT
	PUT EDELWEISS IN FIRE
	ATTACH HELMET TO STATUE
	SHOW PRISM TO PICKLE
	EXIT CAVE
	NORTH
	PONDER MEANING OF LIFE
	
The following verbs must be supported:

LIGHT x
EXAMINE x
GET/TAKE x
DROP x
PUT x IN y
NORTH
WEST
SOUTH
EAST
UP
DOWN
WAIT
ENTER x
EXIT x

Though other paths to victory are, naturally, preferred. This must be a game with a parser, not a simple hyperlink game (such as one made with Twine http://twinery.org/2/).
